/*
 *    This file is part of HMMoC-BFloat-Algebra, a tiny C++ library supplying
 *    the Algebra<> template, for polymorphic representation of non-negative
 *    floating-point values in either native (eg double), log-transformed, or
 *    BFloat representations.  BFloat is the Buoyant Float type, allowing
 *    fixed-precision representation at an arbitrary precision range.  The
 *    library is based on code from: Lunter G. HMMoCâ€”a compiler for hidden
 *    Markov models. Bioinformatics (2007) 23(18): 2485-2487. The code was
 *    derived by Ian Holmes and Gerton Lunter from Holmes I, Rubin GM. An
 *    expectation maximization algorithm for training hidden substitution
 *    models.  J Mol Biol. 2002 Apr 12;317(5):753-64.  You may use at will,
 *    subject to the license (LGPL v3), but *please cite those two papers* in
 *    your documentation and publications associated with uses of this library.
 *    Thank you!
